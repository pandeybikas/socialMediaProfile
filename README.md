# socialMediaProfile
Basic social media webapp built on django
This is a basic socialmedia/profile web app built using django framework
Although the app is simple, i have tried to incorporate important functionalities like:-
 1.  User Registration & login
 2.  Auto profile creation for registered users
 3.  Edit profile information
 4.  Post feed for followers to view
 5.  user can see feeds only to following accounts
 6.  user can follow & unfollow other users
 7.  user can view their post in their profile (you can edit and incorporate your post feed in homepage)
 8.  other users can comment and like to your post and vice versa
 9.  you can reply to their comments
 10.  user get suggestion for new accounts to follow on homepage

Since this webapp is simple, i have created only one app(home) to manage all the pages
apart from pillow to manage images, i have not used any other 3rd party package(pip install pillow)
codes mostly in templates are not formatted properly
